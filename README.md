# mapsTest
Simple app using maps, redux and redux-saga

Objective: 
Add some pins in the map from a typed address.

Why?
I made this app just to test some functionalities like:
- Integrating maps (really really simple try)
- Using redux to reuse components states
- Using redux-saga to make async actions
